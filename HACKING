[1] Strong editorial policies have kept Planet GNOME relevant and readable,
so even though it seems pretty fascist, it ends up being pretty good. The
big problem has been editorial unresponsiveness, particularly when Jeff has
been travelling or otherwise lumped with crazy email load. Let Jeff know if
you have any questions or suggestions about Planet GNOME.

A previous set of suggestions as to what the policy might be was raised on
my blog ages ago: http://perkypants.org/blog/2005/06/10/1118362980/ -- The
objective of writing up the existing guidelines and setting up an editorial
team has been adopted, but is not in place just yet.

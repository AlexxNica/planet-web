Please don't commit to this module without permission from the Planet GNOME
editors (currently Lucas Rocha, Vincent Untz, Jeff Waugh). Strong editorial
policies have kept Planet GNOME relevant and readable, so even though it seems
pretty fascist, it ends up being pretty good.

See http://live.gnome.org/PlanetGnome for more details.

Please don't run update-* manually, they are executed by the update script
and cron, to automagically do the right thing.

Thanks!

Please don't commit to this module without permission from the Planet GNOME

And, ah, that's it for now. :-)

[1] Strong editorial policies have kept Planet GNOME relevant and readable,
so even though it seems pretty fascist, it ends up being pretty good. Let
Jeff know if you have any questions or suggestions for Planet GNOME or the
Planet codebase.

Updating the set of feeds
=========================

Please don't commit to this module without permission from the Planet GNOME
editors (currently Juanje Ojeda, Alberto Ruiz, Jeff Waugh). Strong editorial
policies have kept Planet GNOME relevant and readable, so even though it seems
pretty fascist, it ends up being pretty good.

See http://live.gnome.org/PlanetGnome for more details.

Please don't run update-* manually, they are executed by the update script
and cron, to automagically do the right thing.

Thanks!


Updating the planet software
============================

The planet software we use is logically taken from upstream, which can
be found here:

  https://github.com/rubys/venus

We maintain a mirror of that branch in our "upstream" branch:

  http://git.gnome.org/browse/planet-web/log/?h=upstream

Then we merge any patches that we might have onto our "venus" branch:

  http://git.gnome.org/browse/planet-web/log/?h=venus

Any patch we have there should be submitted upstream as well.

Then we merge venus into master:

  http://git.gnome.org/browse/planet-web/log/?h=master

And that results in a planet-web with our configuration, but upstream
code.

So to update the version of planet, check out the upstream branch and
merge in rubys/venus changes.  Then check out venus and merge upstream,
pinging any patches that are not in rubys.  Then merge to master.
Voil√†!

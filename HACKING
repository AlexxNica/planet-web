Please don't commit to this module without permission from the Planet GNOME
editor [1], Jeff Waugh <jdub@gnome.org>, unless you are:

 * Updating your own RSS feed location

And, ah, that's it for now. :-)


Please don't run update-* manually, they are executed by the update script
and cron, to automagically do the right thing.


[1] Strong editorial policies have kept Planet GNOME relevant and readable,
so even though it seems pretty fascist, it ends up being pretty good. Let
Jeff know if you have any questions or suggestions for Planet GNOME or the
Planet codebase.
